/**
 * The definition of a note within a pattern. When creating a note, it's
 * necessary to inform its pitch, the starting position, the length and the
 * velocity. All of those attributes can be defined as ranges so that, when
 * executed, the note can produce a different MIDINote each time.
 * The position and length of the note are all in relation to the pattern in
 * which it's inserted, considering that the pattern always starts at 0. Both
 * attributes can be specified as an absolute value, and in this case, when the
 * pattern is not executed to its full length, the notes will be cut short or
 * removed according to the pattern's maximum length. Aside from that, the two
 * attributes can be defined in proportion to the pattern's length, so that when
 * the pattern is shrinked or enlarged, the notes will move along with it.
